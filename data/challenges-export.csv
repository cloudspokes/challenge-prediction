This app / set of apps makes that a thing of the past for attendees, sponsors and event administrators.  </p>

<p>At many conferences attendees are required to go to a set of different sponsors and get a stamp on a card.  Once they collect all the stamps they win a prize, get an invitation to an event, enter a raffle, etc.  The purpose of this all is to automate that process through mobile apps that replace the stamps and cards.</p>

<p>In our example, once the attendee collects all the “virtual stamps” they will receive an email (that provides them special access to a VIP event).
There are three mini apps (operating against the same data model) that make up this complete system:</p>
<p>
<b>Stamp Collector (Attendees) </b>– Application that allows the attendee to register, collect ‘stamp’s and see their progress.  This application should:
<br>- Allow you to register your name, phone and email into the app (optionally <br>- your company name)
<br>- Ability enter a stamp (unique number provided by the sponsor) and get confirmation of success for that sponsor stamp
<br>- Ability to view the status of your stamps (ie which 5 sponsors you have entered stamps for, what three you have remaining)
</p>

<p><b>Sponsor Stamper (Sponsor)</b> – Application that allows the sponsor to generate a unique number they give each attendee to act as a stamp
<br>- Get the next unique stamp (unique number) to give to an attendee
<br>- Have this sit behind a protected login
</p>
<p>
<b>Event Administrator </b>– Admin function to manage the event, the sponsors and see / edit attendees status
<br>- Automated email that goes out to the registrant once all the scans have been completed
<br>- Ability to manage the system (setup the template email, view/update the sponsors of a contest, view / update the registration status of a contact).
<br>- Ability to manage the number generator for the sponsors

<div>For customers with flexibility in when their applications can run, Spot Instances can significantly lower their Amazon EC2 costs (a number of our customers have seen savings between 50% and 66% off the On-Demand price).

For example, we have often seen Spot Instances used for batch processing and opportunistic computing, such as: analytics, Big Data processing, financial modeling and analysis, geospatial analysis, image and media encoding, scientific computing, testing, and web crawling. These use cases often are based on grid computing, hadoop based processing (e.g. Elastic MapReduce), queue-based processing, and checkpointing-based architectures. <br> </div>

Once we have completed challenges to design all of the screens and functionality, we&#39;ll put together a final design document (with final ideas from all participants) that we&#39;ll use in the final challenge to build the actual site.<br><br>We just wrapped up our <a href=""http://www.cloudspokes.com/challenges/1569"" target=""_blank"">Mobile CloudSpokes Site VI (jQuery Mobile Challenge Details Page) challenge</a> to design the challenge details page for the application.

The purpose of the contest is to create a tool that will take an mbox file and convert it into an easy-to-read PDF file. Since an mbox file contains multiple emails, each mbox will be converted into a multi-page PDF document.  If the PDF exceeds 10MB, the tool should create multiple documents as necessary.","2012-07-05T13:00:00.000Z","2012-06-26T21:11:00.000Z","Completed","3.0","1350.0","800","1.0","","Code","9.0""1512","The Return of the Quick Quiz","<div><img alt=""User-added image"" src=""http://cs-public.s3.amazonaws.com/quickquizes-logo-transparent.png""></img><br><br><br>Welcome to Quick Quizzes!  Every day thru July 15th, we’ll be giving away $1,000 to the winners of our 5-minute Quick Quizzes.  Choose Javascript, Ruby, Java, or prove you’re a real All-Star by selecting a Random combination of all three languages (but choose carefully -- you only get to compete once per day!)  You’ll be presented with a series of ten questions, and your job is to beat the clock by answering all ten in the shortest amount of time.  Every day, whoever gets the most answers correct the fastest (the number of correct answers is the more important factor, so don’t rush) in each of the three languages will win $200, with the winner of the ‘Random’ quizzes pocketing $400!</div>

<div> </div>
<div>* Displaying the card wall: once the user has selected the object, a card wall should be displayed one column for each picklist value in eZe_Status__c.  Note that different objects may have different number of picklist values, but since this challenge is for a small mobile phone interface, it is ok to assume a maximum of 3 values.  If you choose to support more than 3 values, make sure your user interface is still easy to use.  If you choose to support a maximum of 3 values, you should display a reasonable error message if the selected object has a eZe_Status__c field that has too many values.  Within each column, the app should display all records of the selected object that have that value in their eZe_Status__c field.  For example, in the image above, the selected objects has 9 records, 6 with a eZe_Status__c value of &quot;To Do&quot; , 2 with a value of &quot;Doing&quot;, and 1 with a value of &quot;Done&quot;.</div>

<div>* Returning to the select object interface: after you have selected an object and the card wall is displayed, there should be an intuitive way to select a different object</div>

You should be able to merge up to 3 records in the same object at a time.  The merge page should allow for selection of fields from each record indicating what the current field value is for each record. Please note that Formula and system fields may be displayed, but should not be available for selection. </span><br><p style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; background-color: #e3f3ff; ""> </p>
<p style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; background-color: #e3f3ff; "">This should also allow the ability to update the child records of the victim with the survivor parent record information. This is to avoid the scenario where we would end up with orphan child records. There may be potentially hundreds of child records of various types of objects that need to be merged in this process.<br><br>Special consideration should be given to allow the merging of records where the child records have a master detail relationship. In this case, a clone record of the Non-reparentable record should be created to take it&#39;s place, the merge process should be able to handle ALL non-reparentable object records that exists below the Parent Record being merged.<br><br>Example: Account A has children</p>

The API uses HTTP GET and POST methods to interact with CSV files. Like most requests with Force.com you&#39;ll need a URI endpoint and valid session. The Bulk API does not provide login functionality so you&#39;ll have to use Web Services API to establish a session for the user in Force.com. Once your session is established you call operation specific URIs to process data and request status with the Bulk API. <br><br>To get you started, see my article <a href=""http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Loading_Large_Data_Sets_with_the_Force.com_Bulk_API"" target=""_blank"">Loading Large Data Sets with the Force.com Bulk API</a> as well as some <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/sfdc-bulkapi-demo/source/browse/trunk/demo/src/com/jeffdouglas/BulkLoader.java"" target=""_blank"">sample Java code</a>.

It works well but we would like to make more flexible and easier to add additional scoring types (Code, First2Finish, etc.). Here&#39;s how it currently works from a high-left. A challenge can have N participants and N judges. Each judge fills out a scorecard for each participant. Once all of the judges complete all of the scorecards for all of the participants, a winner is calculated. <br><br>This is where we need your ideas for designing a better one. Using your vast knowledge of Salesforce.com, design principles and recently introduced platform features how can we make this better. Can we implement some sort of &quot;queue&quot; that first async events when new records are created? Are there some Apex design patterns for abstract classes that would make this easier? Can you the Streaming API or Force.com Canvas to make it a better pattern? What are the pros and cons?<br><br>Here are some major actions that occur in the life of a challnege that the scoring engine has to take into effect:<br><br>1.
